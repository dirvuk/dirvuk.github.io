Various generalizations of Gauss quadrature formulas are the subject of research of many authors. Here, interest is paid
to a special kind of quadrature formulas when some nodes are assigned in advance and the others can be taken arbitrarily. In
this article, the performance of process libraries is described. The article outlines the procedures for numerical calculation of
integrals by weights when the integrand function has singularities on one or the both ends of
the integration interval.

The algorithm of working process libraries is also shown. The example illustrates that the developed
library extremely decreases the CPU time, thus improving the recording of computing resources with respect to the standard
procedures of the Maple system. Further, some examples are considered. They show the comparison between the effective
constructed Lobatto and Radau quadrature formulas and the results of other investigations. In conclusion, the example of
calculating the integral with no Chebyshev weight is given. The obtained results can be used both for further research of
quadrature formulas and for study of the properties of rational interpolating functions

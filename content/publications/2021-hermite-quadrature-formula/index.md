In this paper we propose a new approach to the construction of quadrature formulas of interpolation rational
type on an interval. In the introduction, a brief analysis of the results on the topic of the research is carried out. Most attention
is paid to the works of mathematicians of the Belarusian school on approximation theory – Gauss, Lobatto, and Radau quadrature formulas with nodes at the zeros of the rational Chebyshev – Markov fractions.

Rational fractions on the segment, generalizing the classical orthogonal Jacobi polynomials with one weight, are defined, and some of their properties are described.
One of the main results of this paper consists in constructing quadrature formulas with nodes at zeros of the introduced
rational fractions, calculating their coefficients in an explicit form, and estimating the remainder. This result is preceded by
some auxiliary statements describing the properties of special rational functions. Classical methods of mathematical analysis,
approximation theory, and the theory of functions of a complex variable are used for proof. In the conclusion a numerical
analysis of the efficiency of the constructed quadrature formulas is carried out. Meanwhile, the choice of the parameters on
which the nodes of the quadrature formulas depend is made in several standard ways. The obtained results can be applied for
further research of rational quadrature formulas, as well as in numerical analysis.

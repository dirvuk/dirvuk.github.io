A quadrature formulas of rational interpolation-type on the segment is an object of investigation
of many approximation authors’ theory that is defined. Important place in these investigations occupy problems
dedicated to Gauss-type quadrature formulas, that were obtained with means of rational approximation. In this
case orthogonal systems of rational functions play an important role.

The purpose of research is the construction
of Radau-type quadrature formulas for orthogonal systems of rational functions on the segment [−1,1] by weight
that was constructed by E. Rovba. In the main part of the paper the rational interpolating Lagrange
functions with nodes in the zeros of some special rational functions and one fixed point 1 were constructed.
The coefficients of quadrature formulas of Radau-type were calculated with the use of specified Lagrange functions
and estimation of their error in particular. The received results can be used in further research of quadrature
formulas and for studying the properties of rational interpolating functions.

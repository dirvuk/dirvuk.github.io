In the paper we construct a Lobatto-type quadrature formulas on the segment [ 1,1] − by weight by using quasiHermite-type rational interpolation with nodes Chebyshev–Markov. The coefficients of quadrature formulas of Lobatto-type
were calculated and estimation of their error in particular. We give example of the use of these quadrature formula and
compare the rate of approximation of various types of quadrature formulas

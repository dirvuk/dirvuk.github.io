In the introduction of the article, the scientific goal of the work is indicated, a brief analysis of the results
on the topic of the research is carried out. Herein, the methods of the construction of interpolating processes,
in particular, Hermite–Fejér processes, in the polynomial and rational approximation are analysed. The main
purpose of this work is to study a new approach to constructing Hermite–Fejér interpolation rational functions
for one Jacobi weight.

Interpolation rational Hermite–Fejér operators have been well studied
by now in the cases of Chebyshov weights of the first and second kind. It is of interest to consider the problem
of extending these results to other weights. An important role is played by the special rational functions constructed
earlier by one of the authors. They have the property of orthogonality with respect to the considered weight
on the segment [–1,1]. That he zeros of this function are taken as interpolation nodes. One of the main results
of this paper is the proof, The found interpolation rational Hermite–Fejér functions have the property of uniform
convergence on any interval [-1, 1-ε], ε > 0 is fixed, under the conditions of completeness of the corresponding
system of rational functions. This result is preceded by some auxiliary statements describing the properties
of special rational functions. Further, the paper presents a numerical analysis of the efficiency of using
the constructed Hermite–Fejér interpolation rational functions for functions, which reflects the features
of rational approximation. In this case, the choice of poles of special rational functions that determine
the nodes of interpolation is carried out in several ways. In conclusion, the work briefly summarizes the results
of the studies performed and indicates the possibilities of their application. The results obtained are theoretical
and can be used in numerical analysis.

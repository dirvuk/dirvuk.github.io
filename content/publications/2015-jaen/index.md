We present a quasi-Hermite-Fej´er-type interpolation with nodes in the zeroes of
Chebychev–Markov sine fractions. The convergence of the considered interpolation
process for any continuous function on [−1, 1] is proved under the condition of the
completeness of the corresponding system of rational functions. Next we construct
Lobatto-type quadrature formula based on the quasi-Hermite-Fej´er-type interpolation. We obtain coefficients of this quadrature in the explicit form. Also we derive
convergence results for constructed quadrature formula.

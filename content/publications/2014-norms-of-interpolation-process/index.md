In this paper we studied the question of constructing rational interpolation operators of Hermite – Fejer. Uniform convergence of considered interpolation process for function on condition of completeness of system of rational functions is thus
proved. Also, we proved uniform convergence for considered interpolation process for functions f(x)∈C[1,1]  - of complete
system of rational functions The rational interpolating functions construction with nodes in the zeros of Chebyshev – Markov
polynomials of the second kinds.

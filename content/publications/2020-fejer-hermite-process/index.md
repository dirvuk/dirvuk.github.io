In this paper, a new approach to the definition of the interpolating rational process of Fejer – Hermite with
first-type Chebyshev – Markov nodes on a segment is studied and some of its approximating properties are described. In the
introduction a brief analysis of the results on the topic of the research is carried out. Herein, the methods of the construction of
interpolating processes, in particular, Fejer – Hermite processes, in the polynomial and rational approximation are analysed.

A new method to determine the interpolating rational Fejer – Hermite process is proposed. One of the main results of this paper is the proof of the uniform convergence of this process for an arbitrary function, which is continuous on the segment, under some restrictions for the poles of approximating functions. This result is preceded by some auxiliary statements describing
the properties of special rational functions. The classic methods of mathematical analysis, approximation theory, and theory of
functions of a complex variable are used to prove the results of the work. Moreover, we present the numerical analysis of the
effectiveness of the application of the constructed interpolating Fejer – Hermite process for the approximation of a continuous
function with singularities. The choice of parameters, on which the nodes of interpolation depend, is made in several standard
ways. The obtained results can be applied to further study the approximating properties of interpolating processes.

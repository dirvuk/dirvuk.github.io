The research object of this paper are the quadrature formula rational interpolation type on the segment. The major goal is the construction of Radau type quadrature formulas and some of their properties research. At the beginning of the paper specifi ed relevance
of research theme and references to some related articles. The rational interpolating Lagrange functions construction with nodes in the
zeros of Chebyshev – Markov sine-fractures and one fi xed point of –1 and 1 is considered in the present paper. The main part of the paper is devoted to the computation of the coeffi cients of Radau-type quadrature formulas constructed with the use of specifi ed Lagrange
functions and estimation of their error in particular. The received results can be used in further research of quadrature formulas and for
studying the properties of rational interpolating functions.
